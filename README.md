# ðŸŽ‰ GBOT ðŸŽ‰

Family friendly gag bot, endlessly customisable and perfect for irritating your *friends*.

---

## ðŸ¤– What It Does

1. **You** drop your targetâ€™s Discord user ID into an environment variable.  
2. **Bot** hops into their voice channel whenever they join or switch rooms.  
3. **Bot** plays `audio.mp3` on a tight loop (1 s delay by default) until they log off or flee.  
4. **Laughter ensues.** Or violence. Depends on how annoying your audio is.
